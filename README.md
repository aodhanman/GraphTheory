Problem statement
You must write a program in the Python programming language [2] that can
build a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) from a regular expression,
and can use the NFA to check if the regular expression matches any given
string of text. You must write the program from scratch and cannot use the
re package from the Python standard library nor any other external library.
A regular expression is a string containing a series of characters, some of
which may have a special meaning. For example, the three characters ., |,
and * have the special meanings concatenate, or, and Kleene star respectively.
For example, the regular expression 0.1 means a 0 followed by a 1, 0|1 means
a 0 or a 1, and 1* means any number of 1â€™s. These special characters must
be used in your submission.
